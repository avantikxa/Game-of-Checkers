# AI Checkers Game with Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Overview:

Welcome to the AI Checkers Game, a project showcasing the implementation of the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for creating a challenging AI opponent in the classic game of checkers.

## Features:

- **Minimax Algorithm:** The game utilizes the Minimax algorithm to make intelligent decisions for the AI player. Minimax is a decision-making algorithm that considers all possible moves and outcomes to select the best move, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** To enhance the efficiency of the Minimax algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning has been implemented. This technique reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree by eliminating branches that cannot affect the final decision, leading to faster computation.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The game features a user-friendly GUI that allows players to make moves, and it visually represents the current state of the game. The AI player's moves are calculated in the background using the Minimax algorithm.

## How to Play:

1. **Installation:**
   - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Run the Game:**
   - Execute the main game file to launch the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Game Rules:**
   - Follow the standard rules of checkers.
   - Make your moves by clicking on the piece you want to move and then selecting the destination square.

4. **AI Opponent:**
   - Experience a challenging game against the AI, which employs the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for decision-making.
